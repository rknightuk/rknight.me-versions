        <h2>Review: Qik Video Camera Pro</h2>
    

    
        <p><strong>This article originally appeared on AppAdvice</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/9f173c661f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The iPhone camera is severly lacking in features and this applies to the video function as well. If you want to add effects, upload to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, you're going to need an app with a bit more attitude than the standard. Qik Video Camera Pro allows you to shoot video on any model of iPhone including the original. You can add effects, zoom, upload to your computer via wifi, adjust the brightness as well as loads of other features. But is it worth buying if you already have a video recording app? Lets find out.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/24fad57bda.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Works with 2G, 3G and 3GS</li>
<li>Upload to Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Qik</li>
<li>Share via SMS or email</li>
<li>Apply 10 different effects to your videos in real-time</li>
<li>Overlay a photo on top of a video</li>
<li>Upload videos already in your camera roll</li>
<li>WiFi transfer</li>
<li>Export to camera roll</li>
<li>Portrait and landscape recording</li>
</ul>
<p>The interface for Qik gives you access to all the functions so you can get straight on with recording as soon as the app opens. There's a button to record, access settings, library, zoom and a wheel to select the different available effects. You can also increase or decrease the brightness and zoom in, using the corresponding button on the main record screen. To start recording simple press the red record button and away you go.</p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/fb05babe35.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you want to add an effect to your video, simply spin the effects wheel above the main navigation bar at the bottom. Effects available include mirror, sepia, black and white and photo overlay. Each effect shows a real-time preview in a small box on the effects wheel for you to see what your video will look like. Effects can be picked before shotting video, or switched during the recording process. Photo overlay is the only exception as this requires you to pick a photo from your camera roll before you start recording. Once you have chosen one, you can erase parts of it so the video shows through simply by running your finger over the image. Once you have recorded your masterpiece you upload it to four different services; Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or Qik. Simply hit the library button, choose the video your want to upload and away you go. From here you can also add a title, add the video to your camera roll, delete it or send a link to the video (which will be uploaded to Qik) via email or SMS. When uploading to Qik, you can choose to use an existing account, sign up for a new one or 'auto', which creates a 'tempuser972346' username for you. If social networks aren't your thing, and you just want to save videos to your computer, Qik has wifi sharing. Go into the video details page, turn on wifi access and enter the ip address it gives you into your computer's web browser. Remember, this will only work if your iPhone and your computer are connected to the same wireless network. Qik also gives you the option to automatically upload videos to Qik once they have finished recording, which is great if you're like me and don't want to spend time uploading every time.</p>
<h2>The Breakdown</h2>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/d51193c15f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Qik Video Camera Pro offers a varied amount of options to create the perfect video of your mate looking stupid playing Wii boxing, or whatever you might be recording. The interface is easy to use, if a little cluttered, and there are uploading options aplenty. Qik also allows you to import existing videos and upload to the services offered, so this elminates the need to have a seperate uploading app. The quality of the video produced isn't quite up to the standard the built-in app is, but it is high enough that no one would ever notice (I only know it's lower because the app store description says so).</p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<p>As I said above, the interface seems somewhat cluttered and the effects wheel is slow to respond, even on my 3GS. Also, when uploading videos to services such as Twitter or Facebook, there is no option to add a description or any information about what your uploading. On Twitter, this results in a tweet that is simply a huge url to a video. On Facebook, this isn't a massive issue as you can log in and add the info, but on Twitter, once it's there, it's there. There is no way to upload multiple videos which can make uploading very time consuming and also no option to do more than one service at a time. Another small problem I have is when choosing an image for the photo overlay effect, you only have access to your camera roll and not your entire photo library, which annoying for me as I tend to takes photos off the camera roll and into a proper folder as soon as I sync to iTunes.</p>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p>Qik Video Camera Pro covers pretty much every function you could need and having the effects to add makes it great fun to use. Depsite the clunkiness of the interface at times, I would highly reccomend this app for anyone who is dissapointed every time they use the standard iPhone video recording, or for anyone who just wants to add a bit of fun to their next YouTube hit.</p>

        <h2>Review: NextBuses</h2>
    

    
        <p><strong>This article originally appeared on AppAdvice</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/f0d6595edb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>If you travel by public transport in the UK, specifically buses, you know how annoying it is to try and find timetable information on your iPhone. For a while now there have been a few apps to give you train times but nothing for buses. Until now. NextBuses finds your nearest bus stops, gives you times and allows you to save them as favourites for quick access at a later date.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/fb4c2e7ab7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Find bus stops based on your location</li>
<li>Scheduled and real-time departures</li>
<li>Search by postcode, city or near to a train station</li>
<li>Directions of buses shown on each pin</li>
<li>Dual-pane map and list view</li>
<li>Save stops as favourites</li>
<li>Sort by destination or route</li>
<li>Over 370,000 bus stops covered in England, Wales and Scotland</li>
</ul>
<p>When you first open NextBuses, you will see a dual-pane view with a map at the top and a list of nearby stops at the bottom. Once the app has pinpointed your location, red pins will be dropped on the map to show you where the nearest stops are. You can press any of the pins to see the name of the stop, the directions of buses from that stop as well as pressing the blue arrow to see departures from that stop. Departures can also be seen by selecting a stop from the list at the bottom.</p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/6586e3cf87.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On the departures screen, by default, buses are listed by the time in which they are leaving the stop. Destination, bus number and departure times are listed for each bus on this page. Select a specific bus and you can choose to show only buses that follow the same route or ones that are going to the same destination. If the city your in has implemented real-time departures, NextBuses will show it. This is indicated by a clock icon next to each entry, as opposed to the pen/paper icon shown for scheduled departures. NextBuses also offers a manual search option to find bus stops by postcode, a specific area or by train station. If you use specific stops on regular basis, you can add them to your favourites by pressing the favourite icon in the top left. These can be accessed, deleted and rearranged from the main menu by pressing the star button. Another great feature is the ability to rename and assign an icon to a favourite. You can choose from 16 different icons including a bus (obviously!), shopping basket and a beer tankard. This makes selecting which favourite you want far easier than if it was just a list.</p>
<h2>The Breakdown</h2>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/251b7fa588.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I can't vouch for all of the UK, but I have used the app all over the city I live in, as well as other places I've been to in the last couple of weeks, and every stop I have wanted times for has had full and correct information. Also, real-time departures are sparse at best where I live, but whenever these were available, NextBuses indicated this. Accessing the information you need in NextBuses is effortless and favourites can be managed quickly and easily, making access to specific stops simple.</p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<p>There isn't really anything 'bad' per se about NextBuses but there are a few features I would like to see. The first is the ability to choose to open the app with either the dual-pane view or the favourites, as I constantly find myself going straight to my favourites. The second is the ability to switch between dual-pane, just he map or just the list on the main menu. This would be a great feature to make finding stops easier if you're in an area you know (list view) or somewhere you don't (map view).</p>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p>NextBuses has an easy-to-use interface that's so simple to use and yet gives you all the information you need as quickly as possible. NextBuses is a definite must buy for anyone who frequently travels by bus.</p>

        <h2>Review: Analytics App</h2>
    

    
        <p><strong>This article originally appeared on AppAdvice</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/5d8d449988.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>If you run a website, chances are you want to track the amount of visitors and how their getting to your site. Google Analaytics is a great way to track data from your website and Analytics App allows you to see your Google Analytics stats right from your iPhone. You can see an overview for multiple accounts and sites of today, yesterday, the past month, as well as drill down to specifics such as browser version, OS version and location.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/8a65d533ec.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>55 different reports</li>
<li>Multiple accounts</li>
<li>Adsense support</li>
<li>Secure connection to Google Analytics</li>
<li>Customisable date range</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing you need to do to get to your website stats is input your Google Anlaytics login credentials. Analytics App allows you to access multiple accounts (if you have more than one). Once this is done, your ready to start digging. The main screen will show a list of websites associated with the account you are logged into. Select the website you want to see and you will be presented with a list of three different overview reports to look at; dashboard, today and yesterday. The dashboard shows a line graph of visitors to your site as well as visits, page views, average time on site, bounce rate and average page views. Scrolling down shows details of keywords that got visitors to your site, which pages people have looked at, what a visitors location was, as well as which sites they were on before yours. The today and yesterday overviews show the same stats as the dashboard view, but (obviously) specific to the day they correspond to. From the main screen, you can select specific dates to see stats for, simple by pressing the date button and chooses the time range. Below the overview reports are options for far more specific reports such as visitor location, browser and operating system type and version number, flash version, java enabled, connection speed and many more. These options give you quick access to any data you need and each overview page can be seen by numbers, or by percentage. There are also traffic, content and site search reports; basically anything available on the Google Analytics page, is available in this app.</p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/c0716862e3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>The Breakdown</h2>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<p>Analytics app offers everything the full Google site does, in an easy to use interface. Every bit of information can be swapped between actual numbers and percentages and being able to see information for exact dates is excellent. The yesterday overview report is something that even the Google Analytics page doesn't offer and multiple account support is great for those who are tracking more than one site.</p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/b0d53d6d78.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Although you have access to everything you need with Analytics App, getting to it can be slow. After the initial loading of your account, selecting a report will cause the app to start loading the stats. Obviously, I realise the app need to load the information, but it would be far better if data was loaded on startup rather than for each report. Switching between different reports becomes tedious very quickly, especially if you're on a slow network. Also, there is only one graph ever shown and that is on the overview report. I would like to be able to see more specific graphs and charts, like you can on the Google Analytics site.</p>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p>Despite the slow loading times for some reports, Analytics App is a great tool for anyone who tracks visitors to their website with Google Analytics. Analytics App offers more reports than any other app available, including the Google Analytics website. A bit pricier than many apps on the app store, but worth every penny if it's something you'll use on a regular basis.</p>

        <h2>Review: Birdbrain</h2>
    

    
        <p><strong>This article originally appeared on AppAdvice</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/048c6de748.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>If you use Twitter, chances are you want to know who has started, or stopped, following you. Would you like to easily know how many times you've been mentioned in tweets? Birdbrain gives you all of this and more. Followers, retweets, mentioned, blocked and more can be tracked from within Birdbrain. You can get an overview of changes over days, weeks and months to make sure you know exactly what's going on with your 140 character ramblings.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/6efd19cdbb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Overview of following, followers, tweets, mentions, retweets and blocked users</li>
<li>See changes over 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30, 60 and 90 days and 6 months</li>
<li>Pull down to refresh</li>
<li>Multiple accounts</li>
<li>View the timeline of users</li>
<li><a href="http://Favstar.fm">Favstar.fm</a> support</li>
<li>Block/follow/unfollow users</li>
</ul>
<p>When you first open Birdbrain you will see your summary page with stats from your account. Birdbrain has four main tabs as well as a more tab. The first is the summary, or overview page. From here you can see how many followers you have, how many you are following as well as other information. If there has been a change to any of the data in the last 24 hours, Birdbrain will indicate this. Swiping to the left or right will bring up different overviews (e.g. in the last 30 days). There a five of these pages ranging from 24 hours to 6 months. It is important to note that when you first install birdbrain, there will be no changes shown as the app only uses data that has been download through the app. So, the longer you use the app, the more data you will be able to view. The next tab is the followers tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/ae3950fe73.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>From here you can see a list of your followers with either a plus or minus symbols indicating whether they are new followers, or if they have stopped following you. The list is also split into groups depending on when you last accessed Birdbrain and if new follower information was available. The following and mentions tabs show a similar list as the followers tab and, as with followers, you can see more about a user simply by selecting their name from the list. As if you thought that was enough twitter data, going into the more tab allows you to dig even deeper into your account. Want to know who you're following but doesn't follow you? Vice versa? Birdbrain has pages for that. Blocked, retweeted, and specific users can all be accessed from here as well. When you are in any list view, you can select a user to go to a user view page. From here four indicator 'lights' will tell you if they follow you, if you follow them, if their tweets are protected, if you have blocked them as various other information about them. Pressing the settings button in the top right allows you to block, report, follow or unfollow a user as well as view their TwitPic or <a href="http://Favstar.fm">Favstar.fm</a> profile. Also, any of the lists can be refreshed using the Tweetie-inspired pull-down-to-refresh.</p>
<h2>The Breakdown</h2>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/6837427120.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Birdbrain offers everything you need to know about your Twitter account in an incredibly beautiful way. Information is easy to access and the overview pages make it simple to spot changes in your account. Birdbrain really comes into it's own once you have used it for a while, so data can build up. Being able to see how many times you have tweeted in the last 6 months, or how many extra people you are following is great.</p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<p>Birdbrain is so good it's hard to pinpoint any bad points. However, there are a few things I would like to mention. Firstly, there is no support for lists, which considering it's a relatively new feature, is understandable. Saying this, I would like to see this functionality. Secondly, there is no way to change which tabs are accessible from the navigation bar. I would like, for example, to be able to have quicker access to retweets rather than mentions.</p>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p>Birdbrain makes everything from retweets to blocked users easy to view and manage and I'm sure, at it has with me, it'll become one of your most used apps. In summary; if you like stats and you use Twitter, you need Birdbrain. No doubt about it.</p>

        <h2>Review: Wolfram Alpha</h2>
    

    
        <p><strong>This article originally appeared on AppAdvice</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/672f11b0da.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Ever since WolframAlpha realized their $50 mistake and <a href="https://appadvice.com/appnn/2010/04/wolframalpha-popular-2/">dropped the price of their iPhone app</a> to $2, it has shot into the app store top 25. They even offered those who purchased it at the higher price refunds. Now that WolfrramAlpha is actually affordable, this seemed like as good a time as any to review it. WolframAlpha offers a multitude of functions including plotting graphs, calculations and getting data for just about anything. It might be affordable now, but do you really need it? Lets find out.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/4c78b022ba.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Listing features for WolframAlpha is difficult for one reason: it does everything. And I mean everything. It's a calculator. It's a music database. Encyclopaedia. Stock tracker. Dictionary. Currency converter. You get the idea. You name it, WolframAlpha does it. I honestly couldn't go through everything WolframAlpha does, so rather, I'll go through how to use it. First off, WolframAlpha isn't search engine. 'How do I change the background color of my website?' as a search term just isn't going to cut it. But, 'HTML Pink' will show you the hex code, RGB code, complementary colors for pink and other shades of pink. Make sense? WolframAlpha gives information and data rather than links to web pages. WolframAlpha has a custom keyboard for searching which includes the standard qwerty keyboard as well as numbers and symbols above that. This gives you quick access to symbols that you would normally have to press the '123' button to get to. Once you have got the data you were looking for, your results are shown and they will likely include (depending on the data required) charts, graphs, tables, maps and images. You can expand most sections of the data to see more information and access similar data.</p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/7e515b28c9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Everything on the page is rendered as an image which can be saved to the camera roll, copied, shared on Twitter or emailed. You can also copy text from within an image for easy attaching to an email or sms. You can use data from a result as your next search, or 'input'. Similar to clicking on links to Wikipedia, you'll end up looking at data nothing to do with what you starting with (Six Degrees of WolframAlpha, anyone?). WolframAlpha also allows you to open results in Safari, add a specific search to favorites for easy access later as well as use an in-app browser to find out more about a specific subject.</p>
<h2>The Breakdown</h2>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/4b83bb26f0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>WolframAlpha's interface is simply beautiful and it seems every little detail has been thought out carefully. Having a custom keyboard is a great idea that I think more apps should use. Loading times are fasts, there are plenty of examples to get you started and data can be shared quickly and easily. The in-app browser makes it easy to find out more information about a subject and favorites is organize in the same way as Safari for quick access to a subject.</p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<p>Whilst using WolframAlpha I only came across one issue. If you use it for an extended period of time, sections of results from previous searches sometimes become overlaid across the new results which can be fixed by restarting the app. This doesn't cause a massive issue but is annoying nevertheless.</p>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p>As I said at the beginning of this review, WolframAlpha really does everything. Whether you're a mathematician looking for a graphing calculator, a scientist looking for detailed chemical formulas or just someone who is constantly looking up facts and statistics, WolframAlpha has you covered. And at the new low price of $1.99 this app is a must buy.</p>

        <h2>Review: Camera One</h2>
    

    
        <p><strong>This article originally appeared on AppAdvice</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/72589b0cb2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When it comes to camera features, the iPhone's is severely lacking. No zoom, no timer, no effects. But there are loads of different apps that give you this functionality, but most only offer one or two extra features. Camera One offers them all. Self timer, tap to focus, zoom, grid view and voice shutter are just a few of Camera One's features. But would you be better off getting a couple of dedicated apps thinking about quality over quantity? Let's find out.</p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/7147b58224.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tap to focus (3GS only)</li>
<li>Big shutter button</li>
<li>4x Digital zoom</li>
<li>Colour effects</li>
<li>Self timer</li>
<li>Anti shake</li>
<li>Voice shutter</li>
<li>Timestamping</li>
<li>Grid view</li>
<li>Save directly to camera roll</li>
<li>Email photos</li>
</ul>
<p>The main screen of Camera One shows the shutter button, camera roll access button and a navigation bar across the top for turning different features on and off. As default digital zoom is turned on and this is shown with a slider bar above the shutter button. Zoom is just one of the features of Camera One and as the name 'ALL-IN-1' suggests, Camera One has pretty much every feature you could ever want, so lets see what else is on offer. Each feature has its own icon on the top navigation bar, the first of which is the zoom. The next is the 'flash' function. This is supposed to improve photos taken in low light but I really couldn't see any difference in the photos dispute what the screenshots on the app store show. There are two colour effects available which can be toggled from the paint tube icon; black and white, and sepia, although the effect isn't shown whilst taking the photo, only once it has been saved.</p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/6651736a10.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Self timer is something that many camera apps offer and Camera One is no different; you can choose a 2, 5 or 10 second delay before a photo is taken (although how anyone is managing to balance their iPhone to use self timer is beyond me). For those who find the iPhone's default camera button to be a bit small and difficult to use efficiently, the big button option in Camera One might help. Enabling this allows you to press anywhere on the screen to take a photo. Blur is the curse of any photo. With Camera One's anti-shake feature the likelihood of blurry photos is greatly reduced. With anti-shake turned on, a photo won't be taken until the camera is steady. This is indicated by coloured lines either side of the shutter button, which will disappear once the iPhone is perfectly still. Once of the best features about Camera One is the voice shutter. Enable this option, press the shutter button and a photo will be taken when the app registers a certain level of noise (say cheese!). Camera One also offers a grid view which shows an indicator of the centre of the photo for capturing subjects in perfect position. Other features include the ability to email photos, adding timestamps to photos, choosing the output size and tapping to focus on a specific area (3GS only).</p>
<h2>The Breakdown</h2>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/4baa8f1e81.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>&quot;You only need Camera One&quot; is the claim on the splash screen and this is definitely true. Camera One has every feature of every other camera app all rolled into one. Features can easily be toggled on and off and loading times are quick enough for this to be used as a replacement to the iPhone's standard camera app. Sharing photos is quick and easy with the built-in email function and you can also view photos at full resolution rather than scaled to fit the iPhone screen.</p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<p>Camera One offers the most features of any camera app but I find the interface lacks polish. Trying to work out which icons correspond to which feature can be difficult and but there is an explanation of each function in the help section of the settings. The other issue I have is with the 'flash' function. In various different light conditions I couldn't see any improvement in the photos. This is disappointing seeing as the iPhone doesn't have a flash, and if this worked, it would be invaluable.</p>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p>If you feel, like most of us do, that the iPhone's camera app just doesn't cut it then you'd be smart to spend your money on Camera One rather than loads of different single-function apps. Despite some of the issues I've mentioned, Camera One offers everything you could need to take the perfect picture and for $0.99 this app is more than a bargain.</p>

        <h2>Review: Ego</h2>
    

    
        <p><strong>This article originally appeared on AppAdvice</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/ccc5ae8dc3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>If you're like me, you're probably constantly looking at how many followers you have on Twitter or how many visitors you've have to your website. If this is the case, then Ego is definitely the app for you. Ego lets you see an overview of your stats from Twitter, Google Analytics and more.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/879b919ad7.jpg" alt="">]</p>
<ul>
<li>Have multiple accounts from the same network</li>
<li>See stats for;</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>Feedburner</li>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
<li>Mint</li>
<li>SquareSpace</li>
<li>Vimeo</li>
</ul>
<p>To get started with Ego, you need to add some of your accounts. Press the settings icon and choose the type of account you want to add. Input your credentials, and if available, give the account a memorable name (such as your website name). Once this is done, you're ready to check out your stats. The main screen of Ego shows a widget for each of your added accounts, which is coloured depending on the type of account (e.g. the Feedburner widget is red). You can press each widget to get different information depending on the type of account it is and I will go through most of them (I don't have a Mint or Squarespace account) here.</p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/61bc156958.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The three 'social' types accounts you can add are Twitter, Vimeo and Ember. The Twitter widget, shown in dark blue, shows your most recent tweet and how many followers you have. You can also see how many people you follow and how many tweets you have...errr...tweeted. Vimeo's widget shows how many times your videos have been played, how many people follow you and the amount of comments and likes you have. Finally the Ember widget will display how many photos you have uploaded, as well as following and follower totals. Now onto some slightly more 'professional' services. Put your Feedburner credentials in to see how many subscribers you have as well as how many more subscribers you have gained or lost in the last 24 hours. If you have gained or lost any, this is indicated by a green arrow to the right of the widget. If you use Google Analytics to track visitors to your blog or website, Ego has you covered. Pageviews and visits for the past day, week, month and year can been seen from the orange-coloured widget. As I said above, I don't have a Mint or Squarespace account, but if you do, both of these widgets will show you visits and pageviews in a similar vein to the Google Analytics widget. The order of your widgets can be changed through the settings app as well as giving custom names to some of the services.</p>
<h2>The Breakdown</h2>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/mb/2023/9053eeddff.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Ego is a great app for giving you an overview of your stats in the order you choose. The different colours make it easy to distinguish between each service and adding or removing accounts is easy. Also, the interface for Ego is beautiful and really shows how apps should be made.</p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<p>I really like Ego but there are a couple of small things that can be annoying. Firstly, I would like to be able to choose what I am shown first for each widget (e.g. show pageviews this week rather than today). With some of the website analytic services, stats can take up to 24 hours to update, so being able to see stats for a different period as default would be great. Another problem that I feel would affect many users, including myself, is the lack of support for YouTube. Ego offers stats for Vimeo but not YouTube, and as we all know, the latter is far more popular and I feel this would increase the appeal of the app to a larger audience.</p>
<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p>Although there is only Vimeo support for video sharing services, I like Ego so much that I am considering moving over to this from YouTube (hence the lack of stats for the Vimeo widget in the screenshots). Ego, for the most part, is aimed at webmasters, who are notoriously obsessed with stats, but even if you only use one or more of the services on offer (who isn't on Twitter these days?), Ego is definitely an app worth buying.</p>
